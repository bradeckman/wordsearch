# wordsearch

A simple wordsearch solver. Exercise 5 of Intro2CSE @ The Hebrew University of Jerusalem.


### Usage:

* Make sure Python is download and added to PATH
* Download the repo and unzip into some folder.


1. Create a matrix file - a txt file with letters separated by commas and newlines, representing the wordsearch matrix.
2. Create a words file - a txt file with a list of words to search the matrix for.
3. Create an output file - an empty txt file to which the program will write the output to.
4. cd into the root directory of the project. Execute:

   `python wordsearch.py [path-to-words-file] [path-to-matrix-file] [path-to-output-file] directions`

   Where `directions` is any string formed from the letters 'urdlwxyz' representing 8 directions to search in.
5. Enjoy!
